                    Today, on the GCSurplus website, I placed a bid for two Thermix 201T's in broken condition. The current bid was 5$, so to get two of them for 5.50$ would really be a steal. For reference, one of them in working condition could fetch above 100$, what a return on investment right! So I have no idea how these work, or why they're broken, or even if I'll win that auction, but if I do get them, I'll post a project here about fixing them up, or at least doing something with them. Stay tuned for that!

                    Besides that, not much has been happening lately, just coming out of midterm season here at Concordia and one in particular was really quite difficult, the class size after that midterm was a fair bit smaller, but I haven't given up yet. I'll keep you posted about that in the future.

                    This is really the first blog post on this website, I'm not sure how many I will make, or if this will ever go live, but it is nice to have somewhere to write about events in my life and keep track of projects and stuff.

                    I might start working on a video game. This is something that I have always said, then started and immediately given up on. I do believe that it is OK to give up on projects as long as you learn something in the process, no one is going to make the next Elden Ring on their first try after all. Giving up on the game projects is difference however, because I feel like I learn nothing during each attempt, since I give up almost instantly. Recently, I have been working on a Terraria mod with one of my friends. The process has taught me a lot about modding, APIs, and game development, but it might be time to shelve that project and think about doing something new, maybe a Minecraft mod. If I get the motivation, I'll keep you updated with my Terraria mod, or whatever my next future game development project is.

                    I did a couple game jams in the past with one of my incredibly smart friends.They were always a lot of fun, although I never feel like I contributed a whole lot, it was still a learning experience. Maybe I'll try something like that more in the future. In case you're curious, you can<a href="https://chili-b.itch.io/train-main">click here</a>for the link to one of them.
