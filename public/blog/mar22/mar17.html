                    Hey everyone, just a quick update on the two stirring hot plates, they ended up going for over 50$ right at the end of the auction. Sadly, I did not get them and that project is never going to happen. Oh well, you can't win them all.

                    It's been a while since I posted last, and I have been very busy. I went back home to Toronto for my reading week and went skiing at Blue Mountain for a few days. The trip was marred by the fact that my entire family got covid from my sister. I am double vaccinated, and my covid experience was very mild. Just a cough and stuffed nose for a couple days but that was it.

                    During reading week I made the decision to abandon the terraria modding project. Since I have played so much terraria (1000+ hours), I don't really enjoy playing the game anymore, and once the novelty of making the mod wore off, I couldn't find the motivation to continue. In place of that, me and Alice have started a game studio called Schmoovement Games and we are working on our first project. Stay tuned in the projects section to see what becomes of that. I don't mind giving up on the terraria project since I think the scope was too big and I really hate using C#, in my opinion it could be one of the most annoying languages to use, right next to javascript. Programming language discourse will surely show up on this site, but not on this post.

                    After coming back from reading week, it was off again, this time to Mont Tremblant. Tremblant is one of the premiere skiing destinations on the continent, so to have the opportunity to go with my cousins and their parents was incredible. To go from skiing Blue Mountain where the longest run is 3 mins, to skiing a real mountain is an incredible change and I had an amazing time there. I would love to go back, but it's not very feasable on a student budget.

                    Midterm season is almost over, the last one is coming up on monday. I have been doing great in all my classes, except for advanced calculus. The class average on the midterm was close to 17/50. I got 30/50 which was the greatest scolastic achievment of my life. It's not really a big deal since the final is weighted 60% for that course, but the professor writes insane exams, and I think that the class average for that midterm demonstrates my point. Anyways the second one should be easier. Hopefully I pass this class, because I would hate to retake it.
