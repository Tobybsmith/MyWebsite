            You just scanned a QR code without knowing anything about it. Even though QR codes seem harmless, they can link to dangerous websites, download things, or even execute malicious programs. Be careful when scanning QR codes, treat them with the same caution as clicking on random links on the internet. Don't worry though, you're not the only person to fall for this, since 29 March 2022 <span id="visits"> </span> people have scanned this code. Be careful out there!
